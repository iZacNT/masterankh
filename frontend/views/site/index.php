            <h2 class="content__title">How Genie Ping can help you catch Wave 3 of the PS5</h2>
            <p class="content__text">David wanted to get his hands on the latest PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles and had been saving his wages for ages ready for the big release day. Though he’d repeatedly checked the online stores for weeks, he was frustrated to discover he’d still managed to miss out on the PS5 Wave 1 launch, when Sony released a limited number of consoles.</p>
            <p class="content__text">Even more frustratingly, he found out he’d missed Wave 2 as well. His mother saw how disappointed he was, and wanted to help, so she did some research and discovered there was soon going to be another <a class="content__link" target="_blank" href="https://www.t3.com/news/ps5-pre-orders-how-to-reserve-a-playstation-5-now-price-21-oct">Wave 3 release of the PS5</a>, on all the major online outlets.</p>
            <p class="content__text">The problem was, she had no way of knowing when, so she decided to do a bit more searching. That was when she discovered Genie Ping - the answer to her son’s problem.</p>
            <p class="content__text">David’s mother found out that Genie Ping automatically performs frequent checks to see if a phrase or keyword you have chosen to monitor, appears on a specific site. If the text you have chosen is changed, you get an email right away.</p>
            <p class="content__text">Genie Ping will send her email alerts, so she’ll be informed even when she is away from home.</p>
            <p class="content__text">She entered the link: <a class="content__link" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/PlayStation-9395003-5-Console/dp/B08H95Y452/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=ps5&amp;qid=1601837584&amp;sr=8-1">https://www.amazon.co.uk/PlayStation-9395003-5-Console/dp/B08H95Y452/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=ps5&qid=1601837584&sr=8-1</a></p>
            <p class="content__text">And for the Text she entered: <span class="content__text_italic">“Currently unavailable”</span></p>
            <p class="content__text"> <span class="content__text_italic">She then chose the check box for “Text Fail” notification, and she also had the choice to select a “Text Success” notification which she didn’t select.</span></p>
            <p class="content__text">All she has to do now is sit back and wait.</p>
            <p class="content__text">When the text changes from “Currently Unavailable”, Genie Ping will let her know and she can go straight to Amazon.com. This way she has a much better chance of getting her son the PS5 he’s been waiting for.</p>
            <p class="content__text">As well, if Amazon change their URL link, she’ll get an email straight away, and if Amazon re-push a new link, she can update that into Genie Ping too.</p>
            <p class="content__text">David’s mother thought Genie Ping was such a useful tool, she also bought Pings for BestBuy, GAME, John Lewis, PCworld, Shopto, Currys, Argos, Very, and ebuyer and added two pings on every store for the PS5 Digital Edition Console, and the Xbox Series X Console.</p>
            <p class="content__text">Even if she misses out on the Wave 3 launch, she can modify her Pings to monitor a new link and text phrase to keep trying for the consoles.</p>
            <p class="content__text">A much faster way to catch the latest console releases than manually searching every store, several times a day!</p>
